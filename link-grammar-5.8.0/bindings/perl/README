                 Perl bindings to Link Grammar
                 -----------------------------

NOTE:  These are "low-level" autogenerated bindings for perl. A superior
set of perl bindings are the Lingua Link Parser bindings, which can be
found at http://search.cpan.org/~dbrian/Lingua-LinkParser/  You should
almost surely be using those instead of these, here.

See example.pl for a demo.

The build of the perl bindings is disabled by default; there are c++11
incompatibilities in 5.18/CORE/perl.h that cause issues for various
compilers.  You can enable the perl bindings by saying:

   ./configure --enable-perl-bindings
