                   Miscellaneous Utilities
                   -----------------------

The wikipedia scrubbing utilities have been moved to the opencog
repo, here:
https://github.com/opencog/opencog/tree/master/opencog/nlp/learn/utilities/wikipedia

The `cff-to-opencog.pl` utility will convert the relex compact file
format (written out by relex.WebFormat via output/CompactView.java),
and convert it into the opencog format (compatible with what
output/OpenCogScheme.java would produce). It might be buggy, in failing
to correctly escape quotation marks.

The `cpu-control.pl` utility will monitor overall CPU usage on a system,
and halt parsing jobs when the cpu usage gets to high. It will restart
the jobs when cpu usage drops. It has a response time of a few seconds.
